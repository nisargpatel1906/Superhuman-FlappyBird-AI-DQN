An incredibly optimized **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent that learns to play **FlappyBird** at a superhuman level using Reinforcement Learning.

---

## ⚡ High-Performance Architecture

To break past standard Python CPU/GPU execution bottlenecks, this codebase was heavily optimized:

1. **In-Loop Dynamic Optimization:** Instead of waiting for an entire episode (game over) to train a single batch, the agent calls `_optimise()` constantly *inside* the live game loop. The neural network's weights are dynamically updated frame-by-frame, resulting in immense sample efficiency.
2. **Asynchronous Vectorized Environments:** The Flappy Bird simulation runs exclusively on the CPU, heavily bottlenecking the GPU. To fix this, we utilize `gym.make_vec(..., vectorization_mode="async")` to spawn 16 parallel Flappy Bird games mapped directly to the hardware threads of modern CPUs. A single batch of 16 states is generated simultaneously, preventing the GPU from ever idling.

## 📈 Training Results
- **Hardware:** Intel Core i5-13450HX (16-thread), RTX 3050 (CUDA)
- **Total Steps Trained:** ~5.26 Million Steps
- **High Score Milestones:**
  - **101 Score:** Achieved at **2.9 Million steps**.
  - **1000 Score:** Resumed training pushed the model to **5.26 Million steps**, ultimately reaching a flawless high score of **1000**!

## 🛠️ Quick Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nisargpatel1906/Superhuman-FlappyBird-AI-DNQ.git
   cd Superhuman-FlappyBird-AI-DNQ
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv_rl
   
   # Windows
   .\venv_rl\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv_rl/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required packages from the generated `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   > *Note: For optimal performance, ensure you install [PyTorch with CUDA support](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) if you have an NVIDIA GPU.*

## 🚀 Usage

### 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Agent
Run the main script to start training. 
- It spawns **16 staggered async environments**.
- The best model is **auto-saved** to `runs/flappy_bird_v0.pt` whenever a new high score is reached.
- **Auto-Resume:** If you restart the script, it automatically loads the `.pt` file so you never lose progress.

```bash
python agent.py
```

### 🎮 Testing the Agent (Watch it play!)
Loads the saved best model (`runs/flappy_bird_v0.pt`) and renders the game visually with a single environment while locking exploration (`Epsilon`) to `0.0`.

```bash
python agent.py --test
```
